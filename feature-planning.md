# Gift Service - Feature Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Foundation
**Goal**: Basic Spring Boot application with essential infrastructure

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [x] Maven project structure creation
- [x] Spring Boot 3.2.x dependencies configuration
- [x] Basic application.yml configuration files (dev, test, prod)
- [x] Main application class

### 1.2 Domain Layer
- [x] Create all enums (AgeGroup, Gender, Interest, Occasion, Relationship, PersonalityType)
- [x] GiftSuggestion JPA entity
- [x] ConcreteGift JPA entity with relationships
- [x] Basic validation annotations

### 1.3 Database Setup
- [x] PostgreSQL configuration
- [x] Database migration setup (Liquibase/Flyway)
- [ ] Initial schema creation scripts
- [x] TestContainers configuration for tests

## Phase 2: Data Access Layer
**Goal**: Repository layer with basic CRUD operations

### 2.1 Repositories
- [ ] GiftSuggestion repository with Spring Data JPA
- [ ] ConcreteGift repository
- [ ] Custom query methods for filtering
- [ ] Repository integration tests with TestContainers

## Phase 3: Business Logic Layer
**Goal**: Service layer with core business operations

### 3.1 Services
- [ ] GiftSuggestionService with CRUD operations
- [ ] ConcreteGiftService with CRUD operations
- [ ] Service unit tests with mocked repositories
- [ ] Business validation logic

## Phase 4: API Layer
**Goal**: REST endpoints with proper DTOs

### 4.1 DTOs
- [ ] GiftSuggestion request/response DTOs
- [ ] ConcreteGift request/response DTOs
- [ ] DTO mapping utilities (manual or MapStruct)
- [ ] Validation annotations on DTOs

### 4.2 Controllers
- [ ] GiftSuggestionController with basic CRUD endpoints
- [ ] ConcreteGiftController with basic CRUD endpoints
- [ ] Controller tests with MockMvc
- [ ] Global exception handling

## Phase 5: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Search, filtering, and quality-of-life improvements

### 5.1 Search & Filtering
- [ ] Advanced search endpoint for gift suggestions
- [ ] Query parameter filtering for list endpoints
- [ ] Pagination support with Spring Data
- [ ] Sorting capabilities

### 5.2 API Documentation
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger configuration
- [ ] API documentation annotations
- [ ] Example request/response documentation

## Phase 6: Production Readiness
**Goal**: Monitoring, configuration, and deployment preparation

### 6.1 Monitoring & Health
- [ ] Spring Actuator configuration
- [ ] Custom health indicators
- [ ] Logging configuration
- [ ] CORS configuration

### 6.2 Testing & Quality
- [ ] Integration test suite completion
- [ ] Test data builders for consistent test setup
- [ ] Performance testing considerations
- [ ] Code coverage verification

## Implementation Strategy

### Feature-First Approach
Each phase should result in a working, testable increment:
1. Start with minimal viable functionality
2. Add tests before moving to next feature
3. Ensure each phase can be demonstrated independently
4. Keep deployment-ready state throughout development

### Testing Strategy Per Phase
- **Unit Tests**: Service layer business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Repository layer with TestContainers
- **Controller Tests**: API endpoints with MockMvc
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete request/response cycles

### Development Workflow
1. Implement feature
2. Write tests (unit + integration)
3. Verify with manual testing via Swagger UI
4. Document any API changes
5. Commit working increment
