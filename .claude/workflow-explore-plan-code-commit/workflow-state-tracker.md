# Workflow State Tracker

This command provides automated state tracking and guidance for the structured feature development workflow.

## WORKFLOW STATE MANAGEMENT

### State Tracking Variables
```bash
# Current workflow state (stored in .workflow-state)
CURRENT_FEATURE=""
CURRENT_PHASE=""
CURRENT_ISSUE=""
FEATURE_BRANCH=""
TOTAL_ISSUES=0
COMPLETED_ISSUES=0
```

### Initialize Workflow State
```bash
workflow-init() {
    local feature_name="$1"
    local branch_name="feature/$(echo "$feature_name" | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
    
    echo "üöÄ Initializing workflow for: $feature_name"
    
    # Create state file
    cat > .workflow-state <<EOF
CURRENT_FEATURE="$feature_name"
CURRENT_PHASE="EXPLORATION"
CURRENT_ISSUE="None"
FEATURE_BRANCH="$branch_name"
TOTAL_ISSUES=0
COMPLETED_ISSUES=0
WORKFLOW_START_TIME="$(date -Iseconds)"
EOF
    
    echo "‚úÖ Workflow state initialized"
    workflow-status
}
```

### Update Workflow Phase
```bash
workflow-set-phase() {
    local new_phase="$1"
    
    if [[ ! -f .workflow-state ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå No workflow state found. Run workflow-init first."
        return 1
    fi
    
    source .workflow-state
    
    case "$new_phase" in
        "EXPLORATION"|"PLANNING"|"IMPLEMENTATION"|"FINALIZATION")
            sed -i '' "s/CURRENT_PHASE=.*/CURRENT_PHASE=\"$new_phase\"/" .workflow-state
            echo "‚úÖ Phase updated to: $new_phase"
            workflow-status
            ;;
        *)
            echo "‚ùå Invalid phase. Use: EXPLORATION, PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION, or FINALIZATION"
            return 1
            ;;
    esac
}
```

### Update Current Issue
```bash
workflow-set-issue() {
    local issue_number="$1"
    
    if [[ ! -f .workflow-state ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå No workflow state found. Run workflow-init first."
        return 1
    fi
    
    sed -i '' "s/CURRENT_ISSUE=.*/CURRENT_ISSUE=\"#$issue_number\"/" .workflow-state
    echo "‚úÖ Current issue set to: #$issue_number"
    workflow-status
}
```

### Complete Current Issue
```bash
workflow-complete-issue() {
    if [[ ! -f .workflow-state ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå No workflow state found. Run workflow-init first."
        return 1
    fi
    
    source .workflow-state
    
    if [[ "$CURRENT_ISSUE" == "None" ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå No current issue set."
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Increment completed issues
    local new_completed=$((COMPLETED_ISSUES + 1))
    sed -i '' "s/COMPLETED_ISSUES=.*/COMPLETED_ISSUES=$new_completed/" .workflow-state
    sed -i '' "s/CURRENT_ISSUE=.*/CURRENT_ISSUE=\"None\"/" .workflow-state
    
    echo "‚úÖ Issue $CURRENT_ISSUE completed!"
    workflow-status
    workflow-next
}
```

### Set Total Issues Count
```bash
workflow-set-total-issues() {
    local total="$1"
    
    if [[ ! -f .workflow-state ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå No workflow state found. Run workflow-init first."
        return 1
    fi
    
    sed -i '' "s/TOTAL_ISSUES=.*/TOTAL_ISSUES=$total/" .workflow-state
    echo "‚úÖ Total issues set to: $total"
    workflow-status
}
```

## STATE DISPLAY AND GUIDANCE

### Current Workflow Status
```bash

### Workflow Reset/Cleanup
```bash

## AUTOMATED WORKFLOW COMMANDS

### All-in-One Status Check
```bash
workflow-check() {
    echo "üîç COMPREHENSIVE WORKFLOW CHECK"
    echo "==============================="
    
    workflow-status
    workflow-validate
    workflow-next
}
```

### Quick Setup for New Feature
```bash
workflow-start() {
    local feature_name="$*"
    
    if [[ -z "$feature_name" ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå Usage: workflow-start <feature name>"

    git push -u origin "$FEATURE_BRANCH"
    
    echo ""
    echo "‚úÖ Workflow started successfully!"
    workflow-next
}
```

### Installation Instructions
Add these functions to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):

```bash
# Source this file or add these functions to your shell profile
# Usage examples:
#   workflow-start "implement user authentication"
#   workflow-status
#   workflow-next
#   workflow-set-phase PLANNING
#   workflow-set-issue 5
#   workflow-complete-issue
#   workflow-check
#   workflow-report
```

## INTEGRATION WITH MAIN WORKFLOW

The main workflow command should use these state tracking functions:

1. **Start**: Use `workflow-start` instead of manual branch creation
2. **Phase transitions**: Use `workflow-set-phase` for phase changes
3. **Issue tracking**: Use `workflow-set-issue` and `workflow-complete-issue`
4. **Status checks**: Use `workflow-check` for comprehensive validation
5. **Guidance**: Use `workflow-next` for step-by-step guidance

This provides automated state management, progress tracking, and intelligent guidance throughout the entire feature development lifecycle.
