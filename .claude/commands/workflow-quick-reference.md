# Workflow Quick Reference

This is a quick reference guide for the structured feature development workflow. Use this for fast lookups and command reminders.

## üöÄ QUICK START COMMANDS

```bash
# Start new feature workflow
workflow-start "your feature name"

# Check current status anytime
workflow-check

# Get next action guidance
workflow-next

# Validate current state
workflow-validate
```

## üìã PHASE-BY-PHASE COMMANDS

### Phase 1: EXPLORATION
```bash
# Manual setup (if not using workflow-start)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
workflow-init "your feature name"

# Create exploration document
touch your-feature-name-exploration.md
# [Fill out exploration template]

# When ready to proceed
workflow-set-phase PLANNING
```

### Phase 2: PLANNING
```bash
# Create TodoList first
# [Use TodoWrite tool]

# Create GitHub issues from TodoList
workflow-create-issues

# Set total issue count
workflow-set-total-issues 5

# When ready to proceed
workflow-set-phase IMPLEMENTATION
```

### Phase 3: IMPLEMENTATION
```bash
# For each issue:

# 1. Start working on issue
workflow-set-issue 1

# 2. Check success criteria
workflow-check-criteria 1

# 3. Implement solution
# [Write code]

# 4. Verify all criteria
workflow-generate-verification 1

# 5. Commit and push
workflow-smart-commit 1 "implement feature component"

# 6. Close issue with verification
workflow-auto-close-issue 1 "verification results"

# Repeat for all issues

# When all issues done
workflow-set-phase FINALIZATION
```

### Phase 4: FINALIZATION
```bash
# Create pull request
workflow-create-pr

# Or manual PR creation
gh pr create --title "Feature: your feature name"
```

## üîç STATUS AND MONITORING

### Essential Status Commands
```bash
workflow-status          # Current state overview
workflow-next           # What to do next
workflow-validate       # Check for issues
workflow-check          # Comprehensive check
workflow-report         # Detailed progress report
```

### Issue Management
```bash
# List open issues
gh issue list --state open

# View specific issue
gh issue view 5

# Close issue manually
gh issue close 5 --comment "Completed successfully"

# Sync TodoList with issues
workflow-sync-todos
```

## üìä WORKFLOW STATE TRACKING

### State File Location
```bash
# Workflow state stored in:
.workflow-state

# View current state
cat .workflow-state
```

### State Variables
```bash
CURRENT_FEATURE="feature name"
CURRENT_PHASE="EXPLORATION|PLANNING|IMPLEMENTATION|FINALIZATION"
CURRENT_ISSUE="#5 or None"
FEATURE_BRANCH="feature/branch-name"
TOTAL_ISSUES=5
COMPLETED_ISSUES=3
WORKFLOW_START_TIME="timestamp"
```

### Manual State Updates
```bash
workflow-set-phase PLANNING
workflow-set-issue 3
workflow-set-total-issues 7
workflow-complete-issue
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues and Fixes

#### Wrong Branch
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Switch to correct branch
source .workflow-state
git checkout $FEATURE_BRANCH
```

#### Uncommitted Changes
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "work in progress"
```

#### GitHub Issues Out of Sync
```bash
# Check GitHub issues
gh issue list --state open

# Check TodoList
# [Use TodoRead tool]

# Manual sync
workflow-sync-todos
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# Install jq for JSON processing
brew install jq

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login
```

### Reset Workflow
```bash
# Reset current workflow (destructive)
workflow-reset

# Start fresh
workflow-start "new feature name"
```

- ‚úÖ Document everything thoroughly

### DON'Ts
- ‚ùå Skip phases or jump ahead
- ‚ùå Work on multiple issues simultaneously

- ‚ùå Push without testing
- ‚ùå Create PR before all issues are closed
- ‚ùå Ignore workflow validation errors
