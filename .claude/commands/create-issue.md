   - Review enum structures (AgeGroup, Gender, Interest, etc.)
   - Check relationship mappings and database constraints
   - Understand validation patterns

3. **Integration Points Analysis**
   - Identify existing endpoints that might be affected
   - Review service layer dependencies
   - Check repository query methods and patterns
   - Analyze DTO structures and mapping patterns

4. **Testing Strategy Review**
   - Examine existing test patterns (unit, integration)
   - Review TestContainers usage and test data setup
   - Check MockMvc patterns for controller testing
   - Understand test naming and organization conventions

#### 2. Requirements Analysis
**User Requirements Analysis:**

Based on the user's detailed description provided in Phase 0, analyze and structure the requirements:

## üìö INTEGRATION WITH PROJECT WORKFLOW

This command integrates with the main project workflow:

1. **Preparation**: Use this command to create well-researched issues
2. **Implementation**: Use `/project:implement-issue` to work on created issues  
3. **Quality**: Ensures all issues have proper success criteria and planning
4. **Traceability**: Links research findings to implementation tasks

**Usage Example:**
```bash
/project:create-issue "implement advanced gift filtering by multiple criteria"
```

This systematic approach ensures every GitHub issue is thoroughly researched, properly planned, and ready for efficient implementation while maintaining code quality and project standards.
