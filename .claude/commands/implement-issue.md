# GitHub Issue Implementation Workflow

**CRITICAL**: This workflow implements a GitHub issue through systematic implementation and commit phases. Requires issue ID as argument.

---

## WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

```markdown
**Issue ID**: $ARGUMENTS
**Current Phase**: [ISSUE_LOADING|IMPLEMENTATION|VERIFICATION|COMMIT]
**Issue Status**: [Loading|Ready|In Progress|Completed]
**Implementation Status**: [Not Started|In Progress|Ready for Commit|Completed]
```

---

## Phase 1: ISSUE LOADING & ANALYSIS

### ✅ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT 1: Prerequisites
**BEFORE starting implementation, VERIFY:**
1. ✅ Issue ID provided as argument: $ARGUMENTS
2. ✅ GitHub CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`)
3. ✅ Working directory clean (no uncommitted changes)
4. ✅ On correct feature branch

**AUTOMATION**: Validate prerequisites:
```bash
# Check GitHub CLI authentication
gh auth status

# Check current git status  
git status --porcelain

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current
```

### 📋 Issue Information Retrieval

**Load GitHub Issue Details:**
```bash
# Get complete issue information
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,state

# Parse issue content for implementation guidance
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json body --jq '.body'
```

### 📊 Issue Analysis and Extraction

**Extract Key Implementation Information:**

```markdown
# Issue Analysis: #$ARGUMENTS

## Issue Overview
**Issue Number**: #$ARGUMENTS
**Title**: [Retrieved from GitHub]
**Status**: [Retrieved from GitHub]

# Mark issue as in progress on GitHub
gh issue edit $ARGUMENTS --add-label "in-progress"

# Update local development environment if needed
mvn clean compile
```

#### 2. Systematic Implementation Process

**Implementation Steps (follow project patterns from CLAUDE.md):**

1. **Entity/Model Changes** (if required)
   - Modify or create JPA entities
   - Update enum classes if needed
   - Add validation annotations
   - Verify database mappings

2. **Repository Layer** (if required)
   - Create or modify repository interfaces
   - Add custom query methods
   - Follow Spring Data JPA patterns
   - Implement repository tests

3. **Service Layer** (always required)
   - Create or modify service classes
   - Implement business logic
   - Add validation and error handling
   - Follow transactional patterns
   - Implement service tests

4. **Controller Layer** (if API changes)
   - Create or modify REST controllers
   - Add request/response DTOs
   - Implement endpoint methods
   - Add validation and error handling
   - Follow API versioning patterns
   - Implement controller tests

5. **DTO Layer** (if API changes)
   - Create request/response DTOs
   - Add validation annotations
   - Implement mapping logic
   - Follow naming conventions

6. **Integration Tests** (always required)
   - Create TestContainers-based integration tests
   - Test complete user scenarios
   - Verify database interactions
   - Test API endpoints end-to-end

#### 3. Implementation Quality Standards

**Code Quality Checklist:**

### 🔄 CONTINUOUS VERIFICATION DURING IMPLEMENTATION

**After Each Implementation Step:**

1. **Compile Check**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

2. **Test Execution**
   ```bash
   # Run specific test classes being modified
   mvn test -Dtest=ClassName
   
   # Run all tests periodically
   mvn test
   ```

3. **Code Quality Check**
   ```bash
   # Run any configured linting/formatting
   mvn spotless:check
   ```

## 📚 INTEGRATION WITH PROJECT WORKFLOW

### Integration Points
1. **Issue Creation**: Works with `/project:create-issue` output
2. **Branch Management**: Respects existing branch workflow
3. **Code Quality**: Enforces CLAUDE.md standards
4. **Testing**: Integrates with project testing strategy
5. **Documentation**: Updates project documentation as needed

### Workflow State Management
- Updates TodoList items if they reference the issue
- Integrates with existing workflow state tracking
- Maintains traceability from issue to implementation

### Usage Example
```bash
# Implement a specific GitHub issue
/project:implement-issue 42

# The command will:
# 1. Load issue #42 details from GitHub
# 2. Extract implementation requirements  
# 3. Guide through systematic implementation
# 4. Verify all success criteria
# 5. Commit with comprehensive message
# 6. Close issue with verification report
```

This systematic approach ensures every GitHub issue is implemented correctly, thoroughly tested, and properly documented while maintaining high code quality and project standards.
